Tic-Tac-Toe Project for the Odin Project's Javascript Curriculum.

Not upset with this one at all; the decision to pare back the design aspect and focus on the function saved me a fair amount of time here.

The only thing I'm not particularily happy with is the AI function, which simply picks a random square to occupy. 
Revisiting this project in the future, it may be wise to consider what kind of values I could package inside other objects
to aid in creating more robust and less repetitive code.
